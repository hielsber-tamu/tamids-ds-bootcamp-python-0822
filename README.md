## Introduction to Python

Matthew Hielsberg \
August 9, 2022

The opening of the workshops started with the Getting Started slides, which 
give a basic intro into "What is Python" as well as helpful refernces and an 
overview of the cli, IDE's, Jupyter Project, Anaconda and Google Colab.
These slides also give a link to the TAMIDS Training page, containing the
Python Primer (https://training.tamids.tamu.edu/python-primer/).  The primer
covers everything in this workshop and more, and consists of 45 videos + 
Jupyter Notebooks.  

The next portion of the workshop switched to using the Jupyter Notebooks from
this repo (using Google Colab), and introduced the Python Language.
